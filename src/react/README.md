# React Components for MovieVerse

## Overview
This directory, 'react', contains a collection of React components developed for the MovieVerse application. These components are designed to enhance the interactivity and functionality of the MovieVerse app, a platform dedicated to movie enthusiasts.

Please note that the project is currently under development, and the components may undergo frequent updates and refinements - especially the API links (most of which are meant to be secret and are thus not included in this repository). The components are designed to interact with the MovieVerse backend API, which is currently under development. The API is not yet publicly available, but you can contact the project owner for more information.

## Components
The directory includes the following React components:

1. **MovieList.js**: Displays a list of movies.
2. **MovieDetails.js**: Shows detailed information about a specific movie.
3. **MovieSearch.js**: Enables users to search for movies.
4. **UserReviews.js**: Manages and displays user reviews for movies.
5. **MovieRecommendations.js**: Suggests movies to users based on preferences or history.
6. **GenreMovies.js**: Lists movies filtered by a specific genre.
7. **UserProfile.js**: Handles user profile information, including display and edit functionalities.
8. **FeaturedMoviesCarousel.js**: Displays a carousel of featured movies.
9. **index.js**: Serves as the entry point for integrating the above components into the app.
